## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js â‰¥18
- MySQL database (local or remote)
  - Run `docker compose up -d` to start the provided MySQL container, **or**
    update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to point at an existing instance.

### Install & Run
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # add your API keys and DB URL
# optional: change JSON_LIMIT to adjust Express JSON body size (default 1mb)
# start MySQL here if using Docker
npx prisma migrate deploy
# optional: seed sample data
SEED_EXAMPLE_DATA=true npx prisma db seed
# or: npm run seed:sample
npm start        # Express API + Vite (on :3000 and :5173)
# optional: run them separately
npm run server   # Express API on :3000
npm run dev      # Vite on :5173 (LAN accessible)
```

If the `/api/plants` endpoint is unavailable, the app falls back to sample
plants from `src/__fixtures__/plants.json` so you can explore the UI without
running the server.


### Personal Use Tips
- View the app on your laptop at `http://localhost:5173`.
- From your phone, open `http://<your-ip>:5173` and "Add to Home Screen" for
  an offline-capable PWA.
- Build production assets with `npm run build` and deploy the Express server and
  `dist/` folder wherever you host your projects. Use HTTPS for best results.

## Testing
Install dependencies and run the Jest suite:
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
